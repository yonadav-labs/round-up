Hey there,

I wanted to personally check-in to make sure everything is going smoothly with the Round Up for Charity app. The app should be completely automated and running seamlessly for you and your customers. If there is anything I can help you with, please let me know at any time.

If you love the app please let Shopify know! Round Up for Charity donates over $100,000 per month to charities around the world and we need delighted store owners to spread the word by leaving a 5 star rating on the app store here:

Thank you for your help!

Sincerely,
